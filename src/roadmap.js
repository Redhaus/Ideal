// MARK REQUESTS

// COMPLETED
// 1. Better if the pop-ups are not on rollover but on click for the Further Readings. It gets too crazy rolling over them to move the page. I think the pop up should be fine for the lexis...so we could load in the content on those pop ups so it would look cool rolling over them. 

// 2. Can you make the Headers (i.e. primary readings, lexis, further readings) collapse? So it would just show the header but not the content? This would enable a teacher to only have the content open on 1 or 2 things to better focus. Not totally necessary because it might fuck the design...But maybe worth having a look?


// 3. I have a recollection of you sharing some icons that you had made (you have some icons in the demo for download/hyperlink for book). I'm thinking more icons. Here's a list:
// Event
// Person
// Concept
// Device
// •Common
// •Rare
// •Essential
//  Each lexis term would have an icon (or two) beside it. Apollo is an "event" "concept" and "essential". Icons would quickly show that information. The ones with an *at the top are undecided. But, ultimately, the more icons the better. Going to mention in the presentation that we are taking some cues from gaming in our design.

//COMPLETED
// 3.A Based on the icon system above, could we then arrange the lexis by its icon? I click on Event and all of the lexis that have the "event" icon" would be listed together?


// 4. I met with our group leaders to brainstorm and got some good long term plans. One thing that we could do, I can do it in InDesign, is that I'll take one of the Further Readings and do it up like genius.com (Common Core does the same thing in their Close Reader program). So, in the demo, I'll click on a Further Reading (it'll most probably be "The Unknown Soldier" by Auden and it will load up the interactive PDF so that I can roll over the poem to show additional information. Pretty cool. I'll make up the PDF in InDesign.

// 5. Can you take the Quote section (the picture of Levi-Strauss) and offer up other images as thumbnails? So there's the main quote (they would cycle through) but users could roll over a thumbnail and a different image would come up with a different quote. Amazing visual element! Doable?




// BENJAMIN LIST - TO BE IMPROVED

// COMPLETED
// lexisSelectReducer.js - make it so that if checked it will add to results if not it will remove from results currently it adds for every click

// COMPLETED
//filter.js and courseLexis.js getVisibility function accepts filter var such as 'SHOW_ALL' but needs to be able to filter by array ['SHOW_NAME', 'SHOW_PIE']

// COMPLETED
// once filtered, selctions are not working correctly caused by selectedReducer resetting to all
// could be due to need for inputs to be controlled by state
// checked={false}  make this dynamic and connected to state

// COMPLETED
// filter buttons need to be style to show their toggle state.

// COMPLETED
// Add reset button 

// COMPLETED
// Fixed Add filter

// Base goals dont need to be check boxes

//COMPLETED
// Remove summer reading and make it part of previous knowledge
