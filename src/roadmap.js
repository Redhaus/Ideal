1. Better if the pop-ups are not on rollover but on click for the Further Readings. It gets too crazy rolling over them to move the page. I think the pop up should be fine for the lexis...so we could load in the content on those pop ups so it would look cool rolling over them. 

2. Can you make the Headers (i.e. primary readings, lexis, further readings) collapse? So it would just show the header but not the content? This would enable a teacher to only have the content open on 1 or 2 things to better focus. Not totally necessary because it might fuck the design...But maybe worth having a look?

3. I have a recollection of you sharing some icons that you had made (you have some icons in the demo for download/hyperlink for book). I'm thinking more icons. Here's a list:
Event
Person
Concept
Device
•Common
•Rare
•Essential
 Each lexis term would have an icon (or two) beside it. Apollo is an "event" "concept" and "essential". Icons would quickly show that information. The ones with an *at the top are undecided. But, ultimately, the more icons the better. Going to mention in the presentation that we are taking some cues from gaming in our design.

3.A Based on the icon system above, could we then arrange the lexis by its icon? I click on Event and all of the lexis that have the "event" icon" would be listed together?

4. I met with our group leaders to brainstorm and got some good long term plans. One thing that we could do, I can do it in InDesign, is that I'll take one of the Further Readings and do it up like genius.com (Common Core does the same thing in their Close Reader program). So, in the demo, I'll click on a Further Reading (it'll most probably be "The Unknown Soldier" by Auden and it will load up the interactive PDF so that I can roll over the poem to show additional information. Pretty cool. I'll make up the PDF in InDesign.

5. Can you take the Quote section (the picture of Levi-Strauss) and offer up other images as thumbnails? So there's the main quote (they would cycle through) but users could roll over a thumbnail and a different image would come up with a different quote. Amazing visual element! Doable?

Okay. I'm not sure if that list above is radical. I hope not because I have even more radical ideas that I will merely present as aspirations with no demo. Can't demo everything because need to suggest that this task cannot be completed with our current resources. If anything doesn't make sense, let me know. In the end, we are just aiming to get the imaginations flowing. If the functions I outlined above can happen, I think that it would be some pretty impressive additions. I'll sell this thing like Donald Trump.
