dualism
n.

dualistic
adj.

Etymology 

from Latin dualis, from duo ‘two.’ 1755 as a term in philosophy, from French dualisme (1754); also used in theological senses.

“The theory of expression inevitably presupposes a certain dualism between the inner and outer elements and the explicit primacy of the former, since each act of objectification (expression) goes from inside out.”

This is of uncertain origin; perhaps originally “defender, protector,” and from root ser- “to watch over, protect.” Meaning “man who exhibits great bravery” in any course of action is from 1660s in English. Sense of “chief male character in a play, story, etc.” first recorded 1690s. Hero-worship is from 1713 in reference to ancient cults and mysteries; of living men by 1830s. At least from the time of Hesiod (8c. B.C.E.) “man born from a god and a mortal,” especially one who had done service to mankind; with the exception of Heracles limited to local deities and patrons of cities. 

As a rough general formula, ‘a length which allows of the hero passing by a series of probable or necessary stages from misfortune to happiness, or from happiness to misfortune’, may suffice as a limit for the magnitude of the story.”

n.

Etymology

meets Afro-America.”

Henry Louis Gates, Jr.

line
n.


Etymology 

1560s, “any short piece of writing” (especially poetry), from “line” in the sense “row of verse,” attested since late Old English (answering to Latin versus, Greek stikhos). Hence “a few words in writing, a short letter” (1640s); meaning “words of an actor’s part” is from 1882. From 1670s as “outlines, plans” (of a building, ship, etc.); hence, figuratively, “plan, model” of anything (1757). Lines of communication originally were transverse trenches in siegeworks, from “line” in a military sense “trench, rampart,” a collective singular from 1690s given a new currency in World War I. 

“The number of scenes in each act has never been prescribed by rule, but since the whole act must have a certain number of lines which make its length proportionate to that of the others, one may include in it more or fewer scenes depending
on whether they are long or short to fill up the time which the whole act is to consume.”

linear
adj.

linearity
n.

linearly
adv.

Etymology 

1640s, from French linéaire, from Latin linearis “belonging to a line,” from linea “string, line.”

“Sometimes the linear nature of the signifier is not ob,vious. When I accent a syllable, for instance, it seems that I am concentrating more than one significant element on the same point. But this is an illusion; the syllable and its accent constitute only one phonational act. There is no duality within the act but only different oppositions to what precedes and what follows.”

adj.

literally
adv.


Etymology 

late 14c., “taking words in their natural meaning” (originally in reference to Scripture and opposed to mystical or allegorical), from Old French literal and directly from Late Latin literalis/litteralis “of or belonging to letters or writing,” from Latin litera/littera “letter, alphabetic sign; literature, books.” Meaning “of or pertaining to alphabetic letters” is from late 15c. Sense of “verbally exact” is attested from 1590s, as is application to the primary sense of a word or passage. Literal-minded from 1791.

“To understand literally these metaphors or ideas expressed in poetical language, seems to be equally absurd as to conclude, that because painters sometimes represent poets writing from the dictates of a little winged boy or genius, that this same genius did really inform him in a whisper
what he was to write; and that he is himself but a mere machine, unconscious of the operations of his own mind.”

Sir Joshua Reynolds
Discourses on Art

metaphor
n.

metaphorical
adj.

Etymology 

late 15c., from Middle French metaphore (Old French metafore, 13c.), and directly from Latin metaphora, from Greek metaphora “a transfer,” especially of the sense of one word to a different word, literally “a carrying over,” from metapherein “transfer, carry over; change, alter; to use a word in a strange sense,” from meta- “over, across” + pherein “to carry, bear.” Essentially, a metaphor states “this is that.” In this sense, all language is metaphor in that the word “this” is the thing “that.” 

“I want to attract the attention of a young child
who is eating bread and butter and getting the butter on her fingers. I call, “Hey, butterfingers!” This is a figure of speech, a clearly prosaic trope. Now a different example. The child is playing with my glasses and drops them. I call, “Hey butterfingers! This figure of speech is a poetic trope. (In the first example, “butterfingers” is metonymic; in the second, metaphoric-but this is not what I want to stress.)”

A much more vigorous word in Anglo-Saxon than currently, and used widely in compounds such as modcræftig “intelligent,” modful “proud.” To be in the mood “willing (to do something)” is from 1580s. First record of mood swings is from 1942.

“It can be either felt or thought; the two things are similar but different; and it requires practice to do both at once. [...] But it may mean something more important, involving a distinction between ‘sensation’ and ‘feeling’; that what the poet has conveyed is no assembly of grammatical meanings, capable of analysis, but a ‘mood,’ an ‘atmosphere,’ a ‘personality,’ an attitude to life, an undifferentiated mode of being.”

nostalgia
n.

nostalgic
adj.


Etymology 

1770, “severe homesickness considered as a disease,” Modern Latin, coined 1668 as a rendering of German heimweh “homesickness” (home + woe). From Greek algos “pain, grief, distress” + nostos “homecoming,” from neomai “to reach some place, escape, return, get home,” from nes- “to return safely home” (cognate with Old Norse nest “food for a journey,” Sanskrit nasate “approaches, joins,” German genesen “to recover,” Gothic ganisan “to heal,” Old English genesen “to recover”). French nostalgie is in French army medical manuals by 1754. By 1830s the word was used of any intense homesickness: that of sailors, convicts, African slaves. Transferred sense (the main modern one) of “wistful yearning for the past” first recorded 1920, perhaps from such use of nostalgie in French literature. The longing for a distant place also necessarily involves a separation in time.

“Behind these concepts and among those who (properly or improperly) employ them, there is a kind of nostalgia; behind the concept of ideology, the nostalgia for a quasi-transparent form of knowledge, free from all error and illusion, and behind the concept of repression, the longing for a form of power innocent of all coercion, discipline and normalisation.”

omen
n.

ominous
adj.

Etymology

“If we look at comedy, we find that a situation is presented which gradually becomes more ominous and threatening and foreboding of disaster to the characters with which we are sympathetic. Then there’s a kind of gimmick or sudden shift in the plot, and eventually it moves towards a happy ending where everybody gets married, and the hero and heroine’s real life is assumed to begin after the play is over.”

oral 
tradition
n.

Definition 

Oral tradition and oral lore is cultural material and tradition transmitted orally from one generation to another. The messages or testimony are verbally transmitted in speech or song and may take the form, for example, of folktales, sayings, ballads, songs, or chants. In this way, it is possible for a society to transmit oral history, oral literature, oral law and other knowledges across generations without a writing system.

“Hurston’s very rhetorical strategy, her invention of what I have chosen to call the speakerly text, seems designed to mediate between, for fiction
[...] a profoundly lyrical, densely metaphorical, quasi-musical, privileged black oral tradition on the one hand, and a received but not yet fully appropriated standard English literary tradition on the other hand.”

personify
tr. v.

personification
n.

personified
adj.

Etymology 

1727 “to attribute personal form to things or abstractions” (especially as an artistic or literary technique), from person + -fy or from French personnifier (17c.), from personne. Meaning “to represent, embody” attested from 1806.

“The reader will find that personifications of abstract ideas rarely occur in these volumes, and are utterly rejected, as an ordinary device to elevate the style, and raise it above prose. My purpose was to imitate, and, as far as possible, to adopt the very language of men; and assuredly such personifications do not make any natural or regular part of that language.”

plot
n.

plot
v.

Etymology 

Old English plot “small piece of ground,” of unknown origin. Sense of “ground plan,” and thus “map, chart” is 1550s; that of “a secret, plan, scheme” is 1580s, probably by accidental similarity to complot, from Old French complot “combined plan,” of unknown origin, perhaps a back-formation from compeloter “to roll into a ball,” from pelote “ball.” Meaning “set of events in a story” is from 1640s. Plot-line n. attested from 1957.

“The sensuous externality of form is consequently accepted and represented, as in the symbolic type, as unessential and transient; furthermore the subjective finite spirit and volition is treated in a similar way; a treatment which even includes the
idiosyncrasies or caprice of individuals, character, action, or the particular features of incident and plot.”

polysyndeton
n.


Etymology 

the use of several conjunctions in close succession, especially where some could otherwise be omitted (as in “she tried and failed and tried again”). The word polysyndeton comes from the Greek “poly-,” meaning “many,” and “syndeton,” meaning “bound together with.”

“An example of the problems encountered is that both the omission of connectives (here called dialusis; in modern terminology asyndeton) and the repetition of connectives (sunapheia; polysyndeton) can create impressiveness.”

George A. Kennedy

Etymology 

1670s, “principal character in a story, drama, etc.,” from Greek protagonistes “actor who plays the chief or first part,” from protos “first” + agonistes “actor, competitor,” from agon “contest.” Meaning “leading person in any cause or contest” is from 1889. Mistaken sense of “advocate, supporter” (1935) is from misreading of Greek protos as Latin pro- “for.”

“In some stories the protagonist and antagonist are bonded by some essential moral principle, and we can call this relation metaphorical [...] In other stories, however, the protagonist and antagonist circle in different moral orbits, a disjunction we might call metonymic.”

“[T]he question has often been raised why myths,
and more generally oral literature, are so much addicted to duplication, triplication, or quadruplication of the same sequence. If our hypotheses are accepted, the answer is obvious: The function of repetition is to render the structure of the myth apparent.”

Political meaning “overthrow of an established political system” first recorded c. 1600, derived from French. For history, refers to the beginning of a new age, i.e. the American or French Revolutions.

“[L]iterature (it would be better, from now on, to say writing), by refusing to assign to the text (and to the world-as-text) a ‘secret,’ i.e., an ultimate
meaning, liberates an activity we may call countertheological, properly revolutionary, for to refuse to halt meaning is finally to refuse God and his hypostases, reason, science, the law.”

adj.

rhapsodize
v.

Etymology 

1540s, “epic poem,” from Middle French rhapsodie, from Latin rhapsodia, from Greek rhapsoidia “verse composition, recitation of epic poetry; a book, a lay, a canto,” from rhapsodos “reciter of epic poems,” literally “one who stitches or strings songs together,” from rhaptein “to stitch, sew, weave” + oide “song.” Meaning “exalted enthusiastic feeling or expression” is from 1630s. Meaning “sprightly musical composition” is first recorded 1850s.

“[W]hen poetry was recited, it employed the assistance of song; this combination - formed melodic discourse, or ‘ode’; and from ‘ode’ they began to use the terms rhapsody, tragedy, and comedy. Therefore, since “tell” was first used in reference to poetic ‘style’ and since among the ancients this poetic style was accompanied by song, the term ‘sing’ was to them equivalent to the term ‘tell’.”

adj.

rhyme
v.

Etymology 

“agreement in terminal sounds,” 1560s, partially restored spelling, from Middle English ryme, rime (c. 1200) “measure, meter, rhythm,” later “rhymed verse” (mid-13c.), from Old French rime (fem.), related to Old Provençal rim (masc.), earlier ritme, from Latin rithmus, from Greek rhythmos “measured motion, time, proportion.” In Medieval Latin, rithmus was used for accentual, as opposed to quantitative, verse, and accentual verse usually was rhymed, hence the sense shift. Persistence of older form is due to popular association with Old English rim “number,” from  root re(i) “to reason, count.” Phrase rhyme or reason “good sense” (chiefly used in the negative) is from late 15c. Rhyme scheme is attested from 1931. Rhyme royal (1841) is a stanza of seven 10-syllable lines rhymed a-b-a-b-b-c-c.

“Now, that verse far exceedeth prose in the knitting up of the memory, the reason is manifest—the words (besides their delight, which hath a great affinity to memory) being so set as one word cannot be lost but the whole work fails; which accuseth itself, calleth the remembrance back to itself, and so most strongly confirmeth it. Besides, one word so, as it were, begetting another, as, be it in rhyme or measured verse, by the former a man shall have a near guess to the follower.
Sir Philip Sydney

Rhythm and blues, U.S. music style, is from 1949.

“And the worst of it all is that, just as petty lays draw their hearer away from the point and compel his attention to themselves, so also overrhythmical style does not communicate the feeling of the words but simply the feeling of the rhythm.”

simile
n.

Etymology 

late 14c., from Latin simile “a like thing; a comparison, likeness, parallel,” neuter of similis “like.” 

“Only by forgetting that primitive world of metaphors, only by the congelation and coagulation of an original mass of similes and percepts pouring forth as a fiery liquid out of the primal faculty of human fancy, only by the invincible faith, that this sun, this window, this table is a truth in itself: in short only by the fact that man forgets himself as subject, and what is more’as an artistically creating subject, only by all this does he live with some repose, safety, and consequence.”

n.


Etymology 

c. 1300, “one who speaks,” agent noun from speak v.. Similar formation in Old Frisian spreker, Old High German sprahhari, German Sprecher.  For literature, refers to the narrator in a poem, the speaker.

“To the possible difference here belong also the colouring and shading which poetic eloquence seeks to give to the sense. Such colouring and shading are not objective, and must be evoked by each hearer or reader according to the hints of the poet or the speaker. Without some affinity in human ideas art would certainly be impossible; but it can never be exactly determined how far the intentions of the poet are realized.”

stanza
n.

stanzaic
adj.

Etymology 

“group of rhymed verse lines,” 1580s, from Italian stanza “verse of a poem,” originally “standing, stopping place,” from Vulgar Latin stantia “a stanza of verse,” so called from the stop at the end of it, from Latin stantem (nominative stans), present participle of stare “to stand,” from  root stā- “to stand, set down, make or be firm.” 

“Spenser concentrates the reader’s attention on to the movement of his stanza: by the use of archaic words and constructions, so that one is at a safe distance from the exercise of an immediate judgment,’ by the steady untroubled low of similar lines, by making no rapid change of sense or feeling, by sustained alliteration, parallel adjectives, and full statement of the accessories of a thought, and by the dreamy repetition of the great stanza perpetually pausing at its close.”
William Empson

stock 
character
n.


Definition

A stock character is a stereotypical person whom audiences readily recognize from frequent recurrences in a particular literary tradition. Stock characters are archetypal characters distinguished by their flatness. As a result, they tend to be easy targets for parody and to be criticized as clichés. The presence of a particular array of stock characters is a key component of many genres.

“When we speak of typical characters, we are not trying to reduce lifelike characters to stock types, though we certainly are suggesting that the sentimental notion of an antithesis between the lifelike character and the stock type is a vulgar error. All lifelike characters, whether in drama or fiction, owe their consistency to the appropriateness of the stock type which belongs to their dramatic function. That stock type is not the character but it is as necessary to the character as a skeleton is to the actor who plays it.”

Northrup Frye
