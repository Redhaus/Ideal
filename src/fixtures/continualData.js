CONTINUAL GOALS
Rollover The Continual Goals are those that need to be repeatedly covered throughout the course and cannot be contained in a single unit. As the goals are covered, teachers should check them off and attempt to engage with each by the end of the year.

Reading 
indicates goals for students in reading, including note taking, annotating of texts, interpreting data and graphs, comprehending technical or informational texts, as well as visualizing the contents of a text and reading the text out loud.

Writing indicates the essential skills that a student needs to acquire in writing. Many of these goals revolve around the format required by the Modern Language Association, which provides citation and format guidelines that students will use in their humanities classes in university. Additionally, writing goals involve organization, thesis statements, titles, and voice.

Language indicates skills necessary for the close study of language including grammar, research skills, etymology, and a familiarity with idioms.

Interdisciplinary Thinking is intended to persuade students of the interrelationship between different disciplines. Teachers should make best efforts to bring in concepts from other disciplines and apply them to the study of language and literature.

Relate Unit To various philosophical, cultural and metaphysical understandings of the world. This is intended to encourage students to be open to new ideas and various perspectives. In the pursuit of knowledge, it is more important that we posit questions rather than provide answers.

Citizenship is key to a proper education in the humanities where students are to be taught compassion and integrity. Relating their studies to the real world and interacting with the real world helps to bridge the divide between the artificiality of the classroom and the reality outside of it. Students need to have the skills necessary to not only be successful academically, but socially and personally.

citizenship
Rollover Citizenship is key to a proper education in the humanities where students are to be taught compassion and integrity. Relating their studies to the real world and interacting with the real world helps to bridge the divide between the artificiality of the classroom and the reality outside of it. Students need to have the skills necessary to not only be successful academically, but socially and personally.
